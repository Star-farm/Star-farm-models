ORYZA output with climate data from 2025 to 2049
Climate data got from MarkSim DSSAT weather file generator
- Location: Dong Thap (10.546,  105.711)
- Global Climate Model selection: Ensemble
- Emission Scenario: RCP4.5
- Simulation Year: 2035
- Replication: 25
- Methodology: Time Slice approach using 2035 as the representative centroid year.
- Data Structure: 25 stochastic replications were generated to simulate the climate variability and risk profile for the 25-year window, rather than a continuous transient simulation.
