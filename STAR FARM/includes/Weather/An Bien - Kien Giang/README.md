ORYZA output with climate data from 2030 to 2049
Climate data got from MarkSim DSSAT weather file generator
- Location: An Bien (9.946,  105.145)
- Global Climate Model selection: Ensemble
- Emission Scenario: RCP4.5
- Simulation Year: 2040
- Replication: 20
- Methodology: Time Slice approach using 2040 as the representative centroid year.
- Data Structure: 20 stochastic replications were generated to simulate the climate variability and risk profile for the 20-year window, rather than a continuous transient simulation.
